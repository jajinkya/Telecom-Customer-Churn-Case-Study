# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Case-Study 
In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.  
So in this project I have tried to predict whether customer will churn or not using some features. Using this [dataset](https://github.com/jajinkya/Telecom-Customer-Churn-Case-Study/blob/main/telecom_churn_data.rar). There is 226 feature columns and around 100,000 obsevations are given. Since it is supervised binary classification problem; I have used **Precision** and **Recall** as a evaluation metrics.  
Here is the [**notebook**](https://github.com/jajinkya/Telecom-Customer-Churn-Case-Study/blob/main/Telecom_Churn.ipynb) and brief **project report** is [here](https://github.com/jajinkya/Telecom-Customer-Churn-Case-Study/blob/main/Customer%20Churn%20Report.docx).
